title: "Volunteering"
excerpt: "In January 2018 I co-founded *Opera APS*, a Circolo ARCI and cultural center that uses dance and art therapy to support individuals facing psychological challenges. Through creative expression, we provide a space for people to engage with the arts as a means of therapy and personal growth. The same year, I joined *Libera. Associazioni, Nomi e Numeri contro le Mafie* as a volunteer. Libera is a nationally recognised association working on raising awareness about Mafia infiltrations and the threats posed by organized crime in Italy. I also volunteered and took part in projects to restore Mafia-confiscated properties in the South of Italy.
