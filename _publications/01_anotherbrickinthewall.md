excerpt: |
  **Abstract**: Italy's anti-Mafia legislation allows confiscated Mafia properties to be converted into educational, cultural, and welfare facilities where local NGOs offer various social activities specifically targeting youth and other vulnerable groups. Although these activities aim to provide alternative role models and renovate formerly Mafia-controlled neighbourhoods, their educational effects remain unexplored. This study provides the first causal estimation of how exposure to these repurposed spaces affects students' dropout rates by changing their attitudes toward educational and criminal pathways. Using school-level geo-referenced data from 2011 to 2022 and exploiting the staggered timing of property reuse, I investigate changes in local dropout rates. Results reveal a significant reduction in dropout rates of approximately 30% relative to the mean for students near repurposed properties. The effects are not explained by gentrification, additional educational support, or civic engagement levels. Instead, these facilities reshape students' perception, reducing the appeal of Mafia networks while increasing the value of formal education.
