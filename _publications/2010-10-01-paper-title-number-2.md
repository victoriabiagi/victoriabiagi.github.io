excerpt: '**Abstract**: Policies that increase police discretionary authority fundamentally alter police-citizen relationships. Despite widespread use and intense political debate, we know little about how they reshape not only criminal behaviour, but also institutional trust and political preferences in exposed individuals. We address these questions by studying the 2014 Britain’s Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act, which granted local councils authority to implement Public Space Protection Orders (PSPOs) prohibiting broadly defined anti-social activities within designated areas, expanding officers’ enforcement discretion. We construct the first comprehensive dataset on the implementation of PSPOs within the city of London from 2014 to 2024, and link it with crime and police records,
citizen surveys, and electoral outcomes. Exploiting the staggered adoption of PSPOs at the census tract-level, we show that PSPOs increase police stop-and-search activity, especially of non-white citizens, while decreasing arrest rates and prosecution likelihood from these stops. Effects are driven by the most generally formulated and vague PSPOs that grant greater police discretion. Consistent with the policy’s intent, we find a modest increase in reported anti-social behaviours, but the incidence of other crimes remains unchanged. We then investigate the  political consequences of expanded police discretion. After PSPO adoption, neighbourhoods experience shifts in local electoral support away from the Conservative Party, which was the main promoter of these policies, and towards the Labour Party or, within the right, towards UKIP. Finally, we explain these shifts using individual-level survey data on police perception and institutional trust.'
