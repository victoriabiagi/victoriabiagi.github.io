excerpt: '**Abstract**: In 2014, The Anti-Social Behaviour Act gave British councils the authority to implement Public Space Protection Orders (PSPOs) to prohibit specified activities within a defined public area of their jurisdiction. Although this Act left are wide-ranging and flexible institutional powers to criminalise specific behaviours, its localised effects are still unknown. Using data about the implementation of PSPOs, committed crimes and local indicators of voting and human wellbeing from 2010 to 2024, I explore the effects of this policy of crime and local households.'
