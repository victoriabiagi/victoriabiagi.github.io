I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/), and an affiliate PhD researcher at the [United Nations University-MERIT](https://unu.edu/merit). I am currently a visiting researcher at the [CLEAN Unit](https://clean.unibocconi.eu/) at Bocconi University. I hold a double Master of Science in Public Policy Analysis and Human Development awarded jointly by the United Nations University and [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/). My undergrad was completed in 2021 at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en) with the enriching experience of spending a semester at the [Budapest Business University](https://uni-bge.hu/en).

My work mainly relates to political economy, urban economics, and economic history, focusing on the economics of crime. I am currently exploring how crime, organized crime and the public policies to address them affect social outcomes and voting behaviour, utilizing georeferenced and historical data. In my free time, I enjoy painting and crafting, playing the guitar, going for runs, and travelling.
